when
the

began
mcconnell
gave
credit

over

aid
bill
wish
shed
turn
off
those
political
talking

right
the
mark
and
came
while
were
tied
down
the
impeachment
trial
mcconnell
said
hugh
hewitts
radio
program
and

this
out
early
and
was
absolutely
right
former

pointed
this
out

stating
that
the

believed
have
hit
the
united

the
same
day
that
house
democrats
marched
articles
impeachment
the
senate
after
house
speaker
nancy
pelosi
held
off
moving
forward
impeachment
for
weeks
the
senate
majority
leader
took
another
dig
pelosi
for
playing
partisan
politics
time
that
both
parties
had
been
working
together
for
common
goal
noting
how
soon
this
took
place
after

what
really
noteworthy
about
this
pivoted
from

most
partisan
thing
you
could
possibly
involved
the
impeachment
president
unanimous

trillion
dollar
package
all
within
couple
months
said
did
have
outbreak
you
know
kind
the
old
fashioned
impeachment
partisanship
which
think
was
generated
the
speaker
trying
you
know
get
into
the
senate
process
