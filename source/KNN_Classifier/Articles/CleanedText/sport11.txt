the
best
times
during

bitter
rivals
face
off
against
each
other
these
rivalry
matches
are
separate
from
the
crosstown
derby
matches
but
they
create
the
same
hate
and
passion
toward
the
opposing
clubs
perfect
example
this
would
the
manchester
united
liverpool
matches
that
showcase
two
the
most
successful
clubs
english
football
other
rivalries
get
created
through
continental
matchups
like
barcelona
manchester
united
two
the
last
four
uefa
champions
league
finals
these
rivalries
not
only
add
intrigue
the
buildup
each
match
but
they
also
add
the
play
the
pitch
each
rivalry
match
played
world
football
the
impetus
the
players
from
both
clubs
raised
above
their
normal
level
age
limit
all
the
primary
american
professional
sports
require
their
athletes
certain
age
play
for
example
the
nfl
has
policy
that
players
have
three
years
out
high
school
before
entering
the
nfl
draft
the
nba
players
must
year
removed
from
high
school
before
entering
the
draft
world
football
there
are
age
requirements
for
players
take
the
pitch
once
club
thinks
player
ready
play
first
team
football
they
will
throw
that
player
out
the
pitch
the
latest
examples
this
process
are
raheem
sterling
liverpool
and
luke
shaw
southampton
both
players
made
their
debuts
the
age
this
season
and
impressed
their
fans
with
spectacular
performances
sterling
shaw
were
american
football
basketball
players
they
would
not
able
represent
their
teams
until
the
age
the
earliest
historic
stadiums
america
you
can
barely
find
historic
stadiums
that
were
built
over
century
ago
across
europe
and
south
america
that
the
custom
for

palatial

nou
maracana
azteca
and
the

anytime
soon
every
time

sense
awe
and
wonderment
fill
the

body
american

one
the
most
unique
facets
world

their
worst
three

like
american
sports
the
worst
clubs
world

the

the
top
flight
means
everything

some
clubs
relish
the
opportunity
earn
