Software Engineering WiSe 22/23 Project
Project Title: ML22/23-15	Approve Prediction of Multisequence Learning 
Team Name: Team_Matrix
Team Members: Faiz Mohammed Khan
              Shiva Kumar Biru
              Mohan Sai Ram Sarnala

Tasks to be done by each team member  -->
                                        To analyze existing code in MultisequenceLearning.cs & the method RunMultiSequenceLearningExperiment.
                                        To learn how sequence learning and prediction works.
                                        Play around with the ML.NET library and get familiar.

Added new method for testing sequence : RunMultiSequenceLearningExperiment()

21.01.23: Analyzed the Run() method and RunExperiment() method in MultisequenceLearning.cs file. Next step would be test them with string sequences.

//Implemented Code for reading the learning sequences and testing sequences from .txt file the code is implemented in RunPredictionMultiSequenceExperiment() method.

* And the Sequences are in source\MySEProject as trainingSequences.txt & testingData.txt
