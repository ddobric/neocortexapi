**Our Objective:**

+ To demonstrate learning of sequences such as set of Alphabet sequences.

+ Our task is to analyse and understand the solution and Develop the MultiSequence Learning Solution for Set of Sequences of Alphabets and train the model to enhance the sequence prediction.

**Input Sequence Formation for Training:**

S1: HVPEFQOM
S2: ELNAPKMZOYKS
S3: IXORHHDZF
S4: RJAGDLVRCKVX
S5: OMJDGRBEQV
S6: LWUQTX
S7: KNWXVIYMT
S8: OMRDJJWYCPEIIIG
S9: FJCXNO
S10: XLKZYUNCVEAZK


**Approach:**

+ We will try different types of Encoders in HtmPredictionEngine such as ScalarEncoder for Learning Sequence of   Alphabets.

+ we will implement file input operations to read sequences from input files and write results to output files and ensure robust error handling and data validation to handle various file formats and potential issues.

+ Then we design a new method called TrainModel1 to improve the existing functionality. This method should automatically read learning sequences from a file, learn them, and then evaluate the model's performance using testing data.

+ After this we Develop a mechanism to evaluate the trained model's performance using testing data for accuracy.

+ And then we implement automation to load input files, train the model, perform evaluation, and  give the output results.

+ Also, we tried to consider the optimization techniques to improve the efficiency and scalability of the implementation.


**Progress:**

+ Before diving into implementing new functionalities, it's essential for us to thoroughly analyze the existing codebase for multisequence learning. This involves a comprehensive examination of how the code facilitates the learning and prediction of sequences.

+ Now, we aim to gain a clear understanding of its underlying mechanisms and algorithms for sequence processing.

+ And, we are working on it.
